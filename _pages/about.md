Hello!

I am currently working at Microsoft Research India as a SCAI Center Fellow ( Pre-Doctoral ) where I am advised by [Kalika Bali](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/). I aim to develop language technologies (both text and speech modality) in extremely data-sparse scenarios; Additionally, I am exploring how human-data generation pipelines can be made more efficient to maximize the yield of low-resource crowd souricng of data. 
 
Previously, I have contributed to AI4Bharatâ€™s [Samanantar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05596) (Guided by [Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/), IIT Madras), VisionAir (Guided by [Dr. Aakanksha Chowdhery](https://research.google/people/105776/), Google Brain, Work featured by [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/02/visionair-using-federated-learning-to-estimate-airquality-tensorflow-api-java.html)), [NICE Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/koteswarraojerripothula/neatai-servolab?authuser=0) (Guided by [Dr. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula](https://sites.google.com/site/koteswarraojerripothula/home?authuser=0)), and my team's win at several competitive events including [The Singapore India Hackathon 2019](https://mic.gov.in/assets/si2019/si2019winnerteams.html), [Celestini Prize India](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/delhi-college-students-win-prestigious-marconi-awards-for-apps-on-women-safety-and-checking-air-pollution-1611854-2019-10-22), [The Smart India Hackathon 2019](https://www.aicte-india.org/Initiatives/smart-india-hackathon), and the e-Yantra National Robotics Competition. I graduated as the Best Outgoing Student of the Class of 2021, from Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering (B.Tech, Computer Science).

As recreation, I have been learning Odissi, an Indian Classical Dance originating in Odisha, for about 19 years. [Dashavatar or The Ten Primary Avatars of Vishnu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbV-Zkr7J5M&list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=163s) and [Battu](https://youtu.be/icBmrUi6XCI?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=129) are some recitals in this diversely rich art form ( I am the dancer in the pink-purple costume :)). I also enjoy any and every kind of Music.
