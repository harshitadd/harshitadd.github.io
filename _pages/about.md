Hello!

I am a 3rd Year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (LTI, School of Computer Science) where I am advised by [Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com). I am interested in rapidly adapting language models for custom, novel use cases of real-world interest. Towards this, I have studied data selection for [abstract, evolving capabilities](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.103/) and [interactive test data selection]() for such evolving capabilities. Lately, I've also been interested in studying how decisions of Agentic AI populations deviate from human populations (specifically in reasoning patterns). 

Prior to this, I spent 2 incredible years at Microsoft Research, India as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow where I was advised by [Kalika Bali](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/). While at MSR, I studied the compression of Large Language Models ([text](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.80/) and [speech](https://github.com/karya-inc/Karya-MSRI-AmericasNLP)) operating under extreme data sparsity.
I graduated as the Best Outgoing Student for the Class of 2021, from Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering (B.Tech, Computer Science) as well the Best Outgoing Student of the Department of Computer Science.

My earliest formal education started about 20 years ago when I began learning Odissi, an Indian Classical Dance originating in Odisha. [Dashavatar or The Ten Primary Avatars of Vishnu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbV-Zkr7J5M&list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=163s) and [Battu](https://youtu.be/icBmrUi6XCI?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=129) are some recitals in this diversely rich art form ( I am the dancer in the pink-purple costume :)). Consequently, I am also deeply invested in music (any and every form or language - Here is me singing a [Hindi](https://youtu.be/mxkangZmVx0?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=50) Bhajan).
