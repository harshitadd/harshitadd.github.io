Hello!

I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (LTI, School of Computer Science). Prior to this, I spent 2 incredible years at Microsoft Research, India as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow where I was advised by [Kalika Bali](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/). While at MSR, I studied the compression of Large Language Models ([text](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.80/) and [speech](https://github.com/karya-inc/Karya-MSRI-AmericasNLP)) operating under extreme data sparsity. I also led the development of [INMT-Lite](https://github.com/microsoft/INMT-lite), an interactive neural machine translation service aimed at improving the yield of data collection pipelines for extremely low-resource languages. My primary interest lies in studying and adapting to the limitations of Large Language Models: their data dependence (working with sparse data quantities and deficient data quality across dimensions such as bias and out-of-domain samples) and holistic evaluation (Model selection across more human-centric metrics like fairness, privacy and deployment affinity). 

Previously, I have contributed to AI4Bharatâ€™s [Samanantar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05596) (Guided by [Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/), IIT Madras) and VisionAir (Guided by [Dr. Aakanksha Chowdhery](https://research.google/people/105776/), Google Brain, Work featured by [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/02/visionair-using-federated-learning-to-estimate-airquality-tensorflow-api-java.html)). I graduated as the Best Outgoing Student of the Class of 2021, from Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering (B.Tech, Computer Science).

My earliest formal education started about 20 years ago when I began learning Odissi, an Indian Classical Dance originating in Odisha. [Dashavatar or The Ten Primary Avatars of Vishnu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbV-Zkr7J5M&list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=163s) and [Battu](https://youtu.be/icBmrUi6XCI?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=129) are some recitals in this diversely rich art form ( I am the dancer in the pink-purple costume :)). Consequently, I am also deeply invested in music (any and every form or language - Here is me singing a [Hindi](https://youtu.be/mxkangZmVx0?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=50) Bhajan).
