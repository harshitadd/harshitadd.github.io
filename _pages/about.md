Hello!

I am a 3rd Year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (LTI, School of Computer Science) where I am advised by [Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com).  I am interested in enabling real-world users to better elicit and verify the nuanced behaviors they want from AI Models. Towards this, I have studied data selection for [subjective, multi-faceted capabilities](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.103/) like ‘Instruction Following’ and [Evaluation Data Selection for complex, new capabilities](https://custombenchwebsite-802374347260.northamerica-northeast1.run.app). Currently, I am studying how the outputs/decision making process of AI models can be made more verifiable, consistent and readable for real-world users. 

I spent last summer with Amazon's Core Search team studying how we can make agentic simulations in retail more reliable and faithful to the immensely diverse customer populations. Prior to that, I spent 2 incredible years at Microsoft Research, India as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow where I was advised by [Kalika Bali](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/). While at MSR, I studied the compression of Large Language Models ([text](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.80/) and [speech](https://github.com/karya-inc/Karya-MSRI-AmericasNLP)) operating under extreme data sparsity.
I graduated as the Best Outgoing Student for the Class of 2021, from Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering (B.Tech, Computer Science) as well the Best Outgoing Student of the Department of Computer Science.

My earliest formal education started about 20 years ago when I began learning Odissi, an Indian Classical Dance originating in Odisha. [Dashavatar or The Ten Primary Avatars of Vishnu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbV-Zkr7J5M&list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=163s) and [Battu](https://youtu.be/icBmrUi6XCI?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=129) are some recitals in this diversely rich art form ( I am the dancer in the pink-purple costume :)). Consequently, I am also deeply invested in music (any and every form or language - Here is me singing a [Hindi](https://youtu.be/mxkangZmVx0?list=PLtiP2QZNNEeqmAWEsj4Y-N-D3sYh5BnAa&t=50) Bhajan).
