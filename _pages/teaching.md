Here are some very terse tips that _might_ help a wandering PhD applicant. Please bear in mind that I am a very new, unimportant person in this field who is simply documenting her experience in this space. 

## Tip 1: Deduplication is Important

Try not to duplicate information in your CV, SOP, and Application Q&As. Motivate the reasons for working on different problems, **your specific** contributions and how they align with what you would like to do in the Future in your Statement of Purpose. Let the CV do the enlistment of all the other things you’ve done to prepare for Graduate School. A very extreme situation to think of would be something like:

$$Content(SOP)=\overline{Content(CV)}$$

with the exception of listing out your experiences and projects (while specifying the suprisal elements: Code-Bases, Websites, Accompanying Talks and/or Blogs clearly in your CV and providing rationales in your SOP). The listed equation shouldn't be the goal (it definitely wasn't for mine) but it is a good safegaurd to check for unnecessary redundancy between the information in your CV and SOP. 

## Tip 2: Balance is What You (Might) Need

How generalizable future work directions (in your SOP) must be to maximize your outreach whilst still representing adequate clarity about your future goals is a tricky optimization problem. My goal for this was to prioritize the latter while keeping the former as an **undercurrent** or a theme, if you will, for every future goal I wished to work towards with my advisor. Your concluding and introductory paragraphs can further support the latter - where precision may assist the crucial routing of your application to the advisors you wish to work with. 


## Tip 3: Dropout is Inevitable, Believe in its Regularizing Benefits

As a PhD applicant, you might try and incorporate all the advice you gain on maximizing your chances of selection. Some misses in applying this overwhelming amount of advice is inevitable. There will also be other factors that might attenuate your applications effects for unseen reasons (Labs not hiring, Faculty Switches, etc). I faced some of these and this unintended _dropout_ was initially hard to reconcile with. In hindsight though, it contributed greatly to the uniqueness of my application (Accidental Personalization, if you will). For instance, I read work in diverse domains that did not strictly align with my research goals nearly all through my application cycle which greatly broadened my topical horizon in the field. This greatly eased my PhD Interviewing process as I had collected significant evidence to support my choice to pursue certain questions. 

Good Luck and May the Odds be Ever in Your Favor!
