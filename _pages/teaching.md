Here are some very terse tips that _might_ help a wandering PhD applicant.

## Tip 1: Deduplication is Important

Try not to duplicate information in your CV, SOP, and Application Q&As. Motivate the reasons for working on different problems, **your specific** contributions and how they align with what you would like to do in the Future in your Statement of Purpose. Let the CV do the enlistment of all the other things you’ve done to prepare for Graduate School. A very extreme situation to think of would be something like:

$$Content(SOP)=\overline{Content(CV)}$$

with the exception of listing out your experiences and projects (while specifying the suprisal elements: Code-Bases, Websites, Accompanying Talks and/or Blogs clearly in your CV and providing rationales in your SOP). 

## Tip 2: Balance is What You (Might) Need

How generalizable future work directions (in your SOP) must be to maximize your outreach whilst still representing adequate clarity about your future goals is a tricky optimization problem. My goal for this was to prioritize the latter while keeping the former as an **undercurrent** or a theme, if you will, for every future goal I wished to work towards with my advisor. Your concluding and introductory paragraphs can further support the latter - where precision may assist the crucial routing of your application to the advisors you wish to work with. 


## Tip 3: Dropout is Inevitable, Believe in its Regularizing Benefits

As a PhD applicant, you might try and incorporate all the advice you gain on maximizing your chances of selection. Some misses in applying this overwhelming amount of advice is inevitable - and I, a very **un**important person simply sharing her personal experience, _ahem_, believe that this unintended dropout will greatly contribute to how unique and adapted the application is to you (not a direct summation of recipes that others have followed). Do not give up and just brave through the cycle. The results may surprise you! 

Good Luck and May the Odds be Ever in Your Favor!
