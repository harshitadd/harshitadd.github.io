We released [BenchBrowser](https://harshitadd.netlify.app/assets/pdf/BenchBrowser_Preprint__Arxiv_Final_Version.pdf): A tool to help you build more trust in the validity of the evaluations you see for capabilities of your interest! Given your custom use case: BenchBrowser retrieves testcases from 20+ popular benchmarks to assess how your capability is being evaluated and provides a workspace for you to assess if such evaluations lead to consistent conclusions about if a model is good for your task.
